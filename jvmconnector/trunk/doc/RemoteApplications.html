<h1>RemoteApplications - Documentation</h1>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p class='libdoc'>RemoteApplications library is used for launching Java applications in a separate process and taking Robot Framework (RF) libraries into use to operate on them. This is useful when application does something that cannot be tested with RF when running inside the same JVM. Such cases are when System.exit is called in the SUT, when multiple applications running in separate JVMs need to be tested in parallel or when application is started using Java Web Start.<br />
<br />
Using RemoteApplications requires that jvm_connector jar file is in CLASSPATH environment variable before starting RF test execution. RemoteApplications works with Java 1.5 and newer. Following paragraphs contain generic information about RemoteApplications library. See also keywords' documentation for more detailed information.<br />
<br />
Application can be started using RemoteApplications or any other way e.g. using SeleniumLibrary to start Java Web Start application. When the application is started using RemoteApplications, command used to start the application JVM is given to <a href="#Start Application" class="name">Start Application</a> keyword. In case application is started otherwise, RemoteApplications needs to be informed about started application so that it can establish connection to it. This is achieved using <a href="#Application Started" class="name">Application Started</a> keyword. <a href="#Application Started" class="name">Application Started</a> keyword can be also used to connect application started on remote machine.<br />
<br />
After the application is started, there is need to take the needed test libraries into use. That is done using <a href="#Take Library Into Use" class="name">Take Library Into Use</a> and <a href="#Take Libraries Into Use" class="name">Take Libraries Into Use</a> keywords. After that, keywords are ready to be used. Note that you need to take the libraries into use for every application.<br />
<br />
In case multiple applications are started with RemoteApplications library, <a href="#Switch To Application" class="name">Switch To Application</a> keyword can be used to define which application is currently active. Keywords handle always the currently active application.<br />
<br />
<a href="#Close Application" class="name">Close Application</a> is used to close the application. In case application is closed using some other keyword, RemoteApplications library needs to be informed by using <a href="#Close Application" class="name">Close Application</a> keyword. In case you want to close all applications, <a href="#Close All Applications" class="name">Close All Applications</a> keyword can be used.<br />
<br />
Note: RemoteApplications cannot be taken into use with 'WITH NAME' functionality. However, there should not be need for that as the RemoteApplications library can handle multiple applications.</p>

  <td class="arg">alias, timeout=60 seconds, rmi_url=None</td>
  <td class="doc">Connects to started application and switches to it.<br />
<br />
<span class="name">alias</span> is the alias name for the application. When using multiple applications alias is used to switch between them with keyword <a href="#Switch To Application" class="name">Switch To Application</a>.<br />
<br />
<span class="name">timeout</span> is the time to wait the application to be started to the point where the testing capabilities are initialized and the connection between RemoteApplications and SUT can be established.<br />
<br />
<span class="name">rmi_url</span> is url that can be used to connect to the SUT. When used locally there is usually no need to give the <span class="name">rmi_url</span>. However, when the SUT is running on other machine, the normal mechanism used to find the SUT is not enough and you need to provide the <span class="name">rmi_url</span>. In case port is not configured on remote side, you can find the <span class="name">rmi_url</span> after started the SUT using the javaagent. TODO: More details needed.<br />

  <td class="arg">alias, command, timeout=60 seconds, lib_dir=None, port=None</td>
  <td class="doc">Starts the application, connects to it and makes it active application.<br />
<br />
<span class="name">command</span> is the command used to start the application from the command line. It can be any command that finally starts JVM e.g. 'java -jar my_application.jar', javaws <a href="http://my.domain.fi/my_application.jnlp">http://my.domain.fi/my_application.jnlp</a> or 'start_my_app.bat'.<br />
<br />
<span class="name">lib_dir</span> is path to the directory containing all the test library jar files which are required for running the tests. <span class="name">lib_dir</span> is needed in case libraries are not in the CLASSPATH. When application is started using Java Web Start and Java version is 1.6 or higher, <span class="name">lib_dir</span> is mandatory. In case you are using 1.5 Java, you should package all these libraries to the <span class="name">jvm_connector_jar</span> which is set to CLASSPATH before starting the test execution.<br />
<br />
When Java Web Start is used to start the application, there is need to allow permissions for the testing capabilities. Easiest way to do that is to add file .java.policy with following content to $HOME directory or %USERPROFILE% directory on Windows:<br />
| <i>grant {</i><br />
| &nbsp; &nbsp; <i>permission java.security.AllPermission;</i><br />
| <i>};</i><br />
<br />
<span class="name">port</span> defines the port in which the testing capabilities are started on the application. By default port is selected randomly from available ports. <b>NOTE:</b> If the application is used to start other applications and those applications should be controlled with RemoteApplications, port should NOT be given.<br />
