=Robotframework Hudson Plugin=

[http://robotframework.org Robot Framework] Hudson Plugin provides a way to integrate Robotframework test reports into the [http://hudson-ci.org/ Hudson Continuous Integration server]

==Downloading==

Currently the plugin can be checked out from the Subversion repository at https://robotframework-javatools.googlecode.com/svn/hudson-plugin/trunk

==Building==

The Plugin is built using [http://maven.apache.org/ Maven] excecuting the command:
{{{
mvn package
}}}
This will build a plugin installation package: robotframework.hpi into projects target directory that can be installed via Hudsons web interface.

==Installation==

The plugin is installed just like all the Hudson plugins via Hudson's web interface. Go to management screen and click "manage plugins". Then upload the robotframework.hpi and enable the plugin.

(Please read more from: http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Plugins)

==Configuring==

When Hudson is up and running, the installed plugin can be enabled in the job's configuration page by checking the Robot Framework checkbox and optionally specifying the relative path to the Robot reports directory which is relative to the project/workspace directory.
