=Robotframework Hudson Plugin=

[http://robotframework.org Robot Framework] Hudson Plugin provides a way to integrate [http://robotframework.org Robot Framework] test reports into the [http://hudson-ci.org/ Hudson Continuous Integration server].

The plugin is still a prototype and under development, but feel free to check it out and use it if interrested.

==Downloading==

Currently the plugin can be checked out from the Subversion repository at https://robotframework-javatools.googlecode.com/svn/hudson-plugin/trunk

==Building==

The Plugin is built using [http://maven.apache.org/ Maven] excecuting the command:
{{{
mvn package
}}}
This will build a plugin installation package: robotframework.hpi into projects target directory.

==Installation==

The plugin is installed just like all the Hudson plugins via Hudson's web interface. Go to management screen and click "manage plugins". Then upload the robotframework.hpi and enable the plugin.

(Please read more from: http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Plugins)

==Configuring==

When Hudson is up and running, the installed plugin can be enabled in the job's configuration page by checking the Robot Framework checkbox and optionally specifying the relative path to the Robot reports directory which is relative to the project/workspace directory.

==Reports==

Currently the plugin adds links to the job's left side tool panel for navigating to the latest report generated by the build as specified and configured as well as to the reports of the previous builds.
