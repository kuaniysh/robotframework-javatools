!JvmConnector is a module that enables remote keyword invocation. This
is useful in situations where your keywords reside in another JVM than
robot.

===What is !JvmConnector?===

Some java applications cannot be run from within the same process as
robot (eg. Java Webstart apps). Accessing directly this kind of system's
components from outside is impossible and we need to
establish some kind of inter-process communication between robot and
the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_Under_Test SUT].
This is what !JvmConnector does.

!JvmConnector is a proxy library that connects robot to the remote [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_Under_Test SUT]
with [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_remote_method_invocation RMI],
hiding the fact that the keywords reside in another [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jvm JVM] than
robot. !JvmConnector delegates the keyword calls it receives to the actual
keyword implementations on the target [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jvm JVM]. It also takes care of
redirecting all the logging that keywords do on the target system back
to robot and handles exceptions thrown on the remote system so that
robot error messages are presented in a meaningful way.

===!WebstartLauncher===

!WebstartLauncher is a convenience library that comes with !JvmConnector.
It is used for launching a Java Web Start application and for starting a RMI
service inside that application's JVM so that keyword invocations can reach it.

====Example====
*Prerequisites:*
 # You'll need javaws and jybot in the path.
 # [http://robotframework-javatools.googlecode.com/svn/examples/javaws-demo/demo/lib/test-application.jnlp Start the application] manually and agree with the confirmation dialog if necessary.

*Then:*

 # Download the [http://robotframework-javatools.googlecode.com/files/javaws-demo-2009-02-16.zip javaws-demo.zip]
 # Unzip it and chdir to demo directory
 # Run `./run.py test.tsv`

The test applications sources can be found from [http://robotframework-javatools.googlecode.com/svn/examples/javaws-demo/ here].

====Using !WebstartLauncher====

 # Sign testing jars. [http://code.google.com/p/robotframework-javatools/downloads/list Jvmconnector.jar] and all the other dependencies used in testing need to be signed with the same key as your application.
 # Configure your Robot Framework libraries. Here is an example configuration file which imports !SwingLibrary.

 # Copy all the testing dependencies to a directory.
 # When you create the library you'll need to provide the path to the directory containing the dependencies. All the jar files from this directory will be added to your webstart application's classpath: || Library     || !WebstartLauncher || ${CURDIR}${/}test-lib ||
 # Launch the application and the RMI service: || Start Webstart Application And Rmi Service || ${CURDIR}${/}myRmiConfig.xml || http://myhost.com/myApp.jnlp ||
 # Use the [http://robotframework-javatools.googlecode.com/svn/jvmconnector/tags/jvmconnector-0.7/tools/RemoteLibrary.py RemoteLibrary] to open the RMI channel. In the near future !RemoteLibrary will be integrated into [http://code.google.com/p/robotframework/source/browse/#svn/trunk/proto/remote Robot Framework]. Meanwhile you can get it from [http://robotframework-javatools.googlecode.com/svn/jvmconnector/tags/jvmconnector-0.7/tools/RemoteLibrary.py here].  || Import Library || ${CURDIR}${/}test-lib${/}!RemoteLibrary.py ||
 # Start testing, notice that the _first_ keyword invocation will probably have to be done with [http://robotframework.googlecode.com/svn/tags/robotframework-2.0.4/doc/libraries/BuiltIn.html#Wait%20Until%20Keyword%20Succeeds Wait Until Keyword Succeeds] because your application might take some time to start.  || Wait Until Keyword Succeeds || 30 || 2 || Select Main Window ||
 # At the end, close the application. For the moment "System Exit" keyword cannot handle gracefully the shutdown of the Webstart JVM so it needs to be used in conjunction with [http://robotframework.googlecode.com/svn/tags/robotframework-2.0.4/doc/libraries/BuiltIn.html#Run%20Keyword%20And%20Ignore%20Error Run Keyword And Ignore Error] || Run Keyword And Ignore Error || System Exit ||

===Maven2===

To use jvmconnector in your maven2 project add the following sections in your _pom.xml_:

{{{
  <dependencies>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.robotframework</groupId>
      <artifactId>jvmconnector</artifactId>
      <version>0.7</version>
    </dependency>
  </dependencies>

  <repositories>
    <repository>
      <id>laughingpanda</id>
      <url>http://www.laughingpanda.org/maven2</url>
    </repository>
  </repositories>
}}}

For those using jre 1.4 just add `<classifier>jre1.4</classifier>` to the dependency:

{{{
  <dependencies>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.robotframework</groupId>
      <artifactId>jvmconnector</artifactId>
      <version>0.7</version>
