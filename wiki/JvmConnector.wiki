!JvmConnector is a module that enables remote keyword invocation. This
is useful in situations where your keywords reside in another JVM than
robot.

===What is !JvmConnector?===

Some java applications cannot be run from within the same process as
robot (eg. Java Webstart apps). Accessing directly this kind of system's
components from outside is impossible and we need to
establish some kind of inter-process communication between robot and
the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_Under_Test SUT].
This is what !JvmConnector does.

!JvmConnector is a proxy library that connects robot to the remote [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_Under_Test SUT]
with [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_remote_method_invocation RMI],
hiding the fact that the keywords reside in another [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jvm JVM] than
robot. !JvmConnector delegates the keyword calls it receives to the actual
keyword implementations on the target [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jvm JVM]. It also takes care of
redirecting all the logging that keywords do on the target system back
to robot and handles exceptions thrown on the remote system so that
robot error messages are presented in a meaningful way.

===!RemoteApplications===

RemoteApplications is used for launching java and javaws applications in a separate process.

===!ApplicationLauncher (deprecated)===

ApplicationLauncher is used for launching java and javaws applications in a separate process.

===Maven2===

To use jvmconnector in your maven2 project add the following sections in your _pom.xml_:

{{{
  <dependencies>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.robotframework</groupId>
      <artifactId>jvmconnector</artifactId>
      <version>0.7.3</version>
    </dependency>
  </dependencies>

  <repositories>
    <repository>
      <id>laughingpanda</id>
      <url>http://www.laughingpanda.org/maven2</url>
    </repository>
  </repositories>
}}}

For those using jre 1.4 just add `<classifier>jre1.4</classifier>` to the dependency:

{{{
  <dependencies>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.robotframework</groupId>
      <artifactId>jvmconnector</artifactId>
      <version>0.7.3</version>
      <classifier>jre1.4</classifier>
    </dependency>
  </dependencies>
}}}
