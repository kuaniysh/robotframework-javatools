!ApplicationLauncher is used for launching java applications in a separate process and importing Robot Framework (RF) libraries to operate on them. This is useful when application does something that cannot be tested with RF when running inside the same JVM. Such cases are when System.exit is called in the SUT or when multiple applications running in separate JVMs need to be tested in parallel.

===Library documentation===

 * [http://robotframework-javatools.googlecode.com/svn/jvmconnector/tags/jvmconnector-0.8/doc/ApplicationLauncher.html Version 0.8]

===Usage===

Download !ApplicationLauncher.py from [http://code.google.com/p/robotframework-javatools/downloads/list the download page]. It depends on jvmconnector which can be downloaded from the same page. See [http://robotframework.googlecode.com/svn/tags/robotframework-2.1/doc/userguide/RobotFrameworkUserGuide.html#taking-test-libraries-into-use RF UserGuide] or examples below on how to take it into use. Jvmconnector needs to be added to CLASSPATH before starting RF.

===Example===
Application launching and remote library imports are wrapped in a user keyword _!StartApplicationAndImportLibraries_. The idea is to have one !ApplicationLauncher per application and switch between the applications using the [http://robotframework.googlecode.com/svn/tags/robotframework-2.1/doc/libraries/BuiltIn.html#Set%20Library%20Search%20Order SetLibrarySearchOrder] keyword introduced in RF 2.1 in _!SelectApplication_ user keyword.

In this example every application has a unique name. Every application has a launcher with name unique name + Launcher ie. myAppLauncher. In case you need to open multiple instances of the same application you need to have unique names for each instance ie. myApp1, myApp2, etc.
